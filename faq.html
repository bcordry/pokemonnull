                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            Pokémon Null is a carefully crafted, difficulty-driven, Nuzlocke-focused ROM hack based on the Hoenn region. It consists of over 275 battles — both singles and doubles — many of which feature never-before-seen gimmicks. It aims to define a new era in difficulty Nuzlocking.

                            Pokémon Null was created by Terra, a passionate developer, experienced Nuzlocker, and long-time fan of the Pokémon franchise. The project is a fan-made ROM hack and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo, Game Freak, or The Pokémon Company.

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>In Pokémon Null, the starter Pokémon are <b>Chespin, Fennekin,</b> and <b>Froakie</b>. These Pokémon were selected because they are naturally well-balanced and closely matched in overall viability, which supports a fair and consistent Nuzlocke experience.</p>
                            <p>Their respective strengths and weaknesses create meaningful strategic differences without any one option being clearly dominant. While personal preference played no significant role in the design process, it is worth noting that Greninja is the creator's favorite Pokémon, which may have had a minor influence on the final selection.</p>

                    <!-- Level cap -->
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <button class="faq-question">Why is the Level Cap for the first Gym so high?</button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>This project is designed first and foremost around a balanced, Nuzlocke-oriented experience with naturally scaling difficulty. At very low levels, Pokémon battles suffer from extreme damage variance due to how the damage formula works. Small level differences create disproportionately large power swings.</p>
                            <p>If the player is even slightly overleveled, they gain an overwhelming advantage. Conversely, once the AI catches up, that advantage often flips sharply in the AI's favor to an extent that is rarely perceived as fun. This results in an unhealthy difficulty curve where early trainers are trivial, followed by sudden and severe difficulty spikes. Damage calculations at low levels illustrate this clearly: a difference of just one or two levels can mean the difference between a guaranteed 2HKO and a guaranteed OHKO.</p>
                            <p>At higher levels, damage scales far more smoothly. Level differences still matter, but they do not radically alter outcomes, creating a more stable and predictable battle environment. This is the level range I consider balanced and appropriate for a challenging but fair Nuzlocke experience.</p>
                            <div class="damage-calc-example">
                                <strong>Low-Level Variance:</strong><br>
                                Lvl 4 vs Lvl 5: 12–16 (50–66.6%) — guaranteed 2HKO<br>
                                Lvl 5 vs Lvl 5: 20–24 (83.3–100%) — 6.3% chance to OHKO<br>
                                Lvl 6 vs Lvl 5: 24–30 (100–125%) — guaranteed OHKO<br><br>
                                <strong>High-Level Stability:</strong><br>
                                Lvl 79 vs Lvl 80: 168–198 (70.5–83.1%) — guaranteed 2HKO<br>
                                Lvl 80 vs Lvl 80: 176–208 (73.9–87.3%) — guaranteed 2HKO<br>
                                Lvl 81 vs Lvl 80: 178–210 (74.7–88.2%) — guaranteed 2HKO
                            </div>
                            <p>Thematically, the higher level cap also reinforces the idea of a training arc before challenging the first Gym. Gym Leaders are officially employed by the Pokémon League and are among the strongest trainers in the region; a weak first Gym centered around a low-level Geodude would not make narrative sense in this setting.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <button class="faq-question">Why can certain Pokémon be inflicted with a status condition they are normally immune to?</button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Some mechanics in the game are intentionally designed to bypass standard type-based status immunities.</p>
                            <p>For example, early in the game you may encounter a Lapras that knows <i>Soak</i> and <i>Tri Attack</i>. <i>Soak</i> changes the target's type to Water, temporarily removing its original type-based immunities. This allows <i>Tri Attack</i> to inflict burn, freeze, or paralysis even on Pokémon that would normally be immune.</p>
                            <p>Similarly, wild Salandit possess the Ability Corrosion, which allows them to poison any Pokémon regardless of its type. Combined with moves such as <i>Poison Gas</i> or <i>Toxic</i>, this enables them to inflict poison even on Poison- or Steel-type Pokémon.</p>

                    </div>

                    <!-- Legendaries -->
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <button class="faq-question">Why do some Legendary Pokémon appear early, and why do regular Trainers use them?</button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Within the story of Pokémon Null, most Legendary Pokémon have reproduced over time and, as a result, lost their unique "legendary" status. Consequently, Pokémon such as Mesprit or Solgaleo are no longer treated as legendaries in either a narrative or gameplay sense. Within this canon, the only Pokémon considered truly legendary are Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza.</p>
                            <p>From a balance perspective, this choice allows the game to meaningfully incorporate every Pokémon rather than reserving traditionally powerful species exclusively for the late game. This prevents excessive legendary concentration later on and ensures players encounter a wide variety of species throughout the entire journey.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately, this design philosophy aims to demonstrate that a fair and engaging challenge is possible even when facing "legendary" Pokémon, provided the encounters are constructed thoughtfully.</p>

                        <button class="faq-question">Why is this game so difficult? This is bullshit!</button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>This project is intentionally designed for a very specific audience: players who are already highly experienced with Nuzlocke challenges and have completed some of the most demanding ROM hacks available. As such, the difficulty accurately reflects the intended target audience.</p>
                            <p>The game assumes a high level of mechanical knowledge, planning, and adaptability from the player, and it does not attempt to accommodate more casual playstyles. Even for its intended audience, the difficulty is deliberately pushed beyond comfort levels, with the goal of forcing players to struggle, adapt, and meaningfully improve rather than rely on familiar solutions.</p>
                            <p>If this level of challenge is not enjoyable for you, that is completely understandable — difficulty preferences vary widely. In that case, there are many excellent ROM hacks with a more moderate difficulty curve, such as FireRed Omega or Renegade Platinum, which may better suit your tastes. After gaining experience with such projects, this game may become more approachable and enjoyable, as player proficiency naturally develops over time.</p>

                            Patch updates are posted on the Patch page and in the <a href="https://discord.gg/DqxxC5KQ6r">Pokémon Null Discord</a> server. Updates will always be announced on Discord first, so I recommend keeping an eye on the announcement channels there.

                            Please report bugs in the #bug-reports channel of the official <a href="https://discord.gg/DqxxC5KQ6r">Pokémon Null Discord</a> server. Include as many details as possible — where the bug occurred, what you were doing, and any relevant screenshots or videos. Clear reports make it much easier to diagnose and fix issues.

                            <p>One area where contributions are welcome is the creation of custom trainer battle themes. If you have experience in this area and are familiar with the technical limitations of the Game Boy Advance, your input may be valuable.
